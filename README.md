# Gas Optimization Audit Report - MockStaking721

## Overview

- **Contract Audited:** MockStaking721.sol & MockStaking721Optimized.sol
- **Optimization Techniques Used:** Storage slot packing, mappings instead of arrays, inline assembly, gas-efficient reentrancy protection
- **Audit Focus:** Reducing gas costs for deployment and function execution
- **Findings Summary:**
  - **Deployment Gas Reduced:** 2,653,303 -> 2,222,732 (↓ 16.2%)
  - **Deployment Size Reduced:** 12,410 -> 10,405 (↓ 16.1%)
  - **Gas Savings on Function Calls:** Significant reductions in storage-heavy functions

## Optimizations & Gas Savings

### 1️⃣ Implemented Reentrancy Guard Inside Contract

- Removed dependency on OpenZeppelin’s `ReentrancyGuard`.
- Implemented a custom reentrancy guard using `_status` variable.
- **Gas Improvement:** Avoids external library calls, reducing contract size and function execution costs.

### 2️⃣ Reduced Storage Access with Local Variables

- Before: Functions accessed storage multiple times within loops.
- After: Created local variables to store frequently accessed values.
- **Gas Improvement:** Reduced redundant SLOAD operations.

### 3️⃣ Packed Variables into a Single Storage Slot

- **Before:** Variables were stored in separate storage slots:
- **After:** These variables were grouped into a single slot for better storage efficiency.
- **Gas Improvement:** Saves gas for the storage.

### 4️⃣ Replaced Arrays with Mappings

- **Before:** Used arrays to track staked token IDs:
  ```solidity
  uint256[] public indexedTokens;
  address[] public stakersArray;
  ```
- **After:** Switched to mappings:
  ```solidity
  mapping(address => uint256[]) public stakerTokens;
  ```
- **Main Benefit:**
  - Arrays required dynamic resizing and shifting elements → **Expensive**.
  - Mappings allow direct access to data with **constant time complexity (O(1))**.
  - **Gas Improvement:** Reduced loop iterations and expensive storage modifications.
